# Image Compression
Optimal image compression for efficient reconstruction using unsupervised learning.

Unsupervised learning algorithms attempt to learn some structure of the data using unlabeled samples like images. Here we will use K-Means to achieve optimal compression for efficient reconstruction of images.
